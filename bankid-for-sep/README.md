**Basic Information**

Bank iD is only required to implement APIs that are specified in this document, as that is what will be used by the SeP.
However for additional explanations and details, it is strongly recommended that readers are familiar with the specifications below.


**Verified Data Representation extension for /userinfo and /profile resource**

This extension to OpenID Connect wants to ensure that IDPs cannot mix up verified and unverified Claims and incidentally process unverified Claims as verified Claims.

The representation proposed therefore provides the IDP with the verified Claims within a container element verified_claims. This container is composed of the verification  evidence related to a certain verification process and the corresponding Claims about the End-User which were verified in this process.

Verification elements contains the information about the process conducted to verify a person's identity and bind the respective person data to a user account.


**Source material and relevant modifications:**

* [OpenID Connect Core 1.0](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html) 

  * Signed and encrypted JWTs MAY be used for /userinfo and /profile responses
  * In Service Provider's Bank iD relationship the UserInfo Claims MUST be returned as the members of a JSON object unless a signed or encrypted response was requested during Client Registration.
  * The sub (subject) Claim MUST always be returned in the UserInfo Response.
  * If a Claim is not returned, that Claim Name SHOULD be omitted from the JSON object representing the Claims; it SHOULD NOT be present with a null or empty string value.
  * The sub Claim in the UserInfo and Profile Response MUST be verified to exactly match the sub Claim in the ID Token; if they do not match, the UserInfo Response values MUST NOT be used.
  * The UserInfo and Profile Endpoint MUST return a content-type header to indicate which format is being returned and if the response body is a text JSON object; the response body SHOULD be encoded using UTF-8.
  * If the UserInfo or Profile Response is signed and/or encrypted, then the Claims are returned in a JWT and the content-type MUST be application/jwt. The response MAY be encrypted without also being signed. If both signing and encryption are requested, the response MUST be signed then encrypted, with the result being a Nested JWT.

* [OpenID Connect for Identity Assurance 1.0](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-4-identity-assurance-1_0.html)

  * The `txn` Claim as defined in [RFC8417](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8417) is used in the context of Bank iD data exchange to build audit trails across the parties involved in an OpenID Connect transaction. Claim txn is always REQUIRED in the userinfo response content.
  * This arrangement introduces the possibility for the bank to separate the verified Claims within a container element `verified_claims`. This container is composed of the  verification evidence related to a certain verification process and the corresponding Claims about the End-User which were verified in this process.
  * Implementations MUST ignore any sub-element not defined in this specification or extensions of this specification.
  * In the case of this definition verification element MUST consist of the following elements:
     * `trust_framework`: REQUIRED. String determining the trust framework governing the identity verification process. For example, the value of ``cz_aml`` for verification according to the Czech AML law.
     * `time`: OPTIONAL. Time stamp in ISO 8601:2004 [ISO8601-2004] YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss±hh format representing the date and time when identity verification took place.
     * `verification_process`: REQUIRED. In the case of this specification, the verification process shall include the identification number of the relevant bank where the initial physical verification of the client took place. This is the bank's identification number, which is kept in the list of regulated and registered entities of the CNB JERRS.
     * `claims`: The claims element contains the claims about the End-User that were verified during the defined verification process.
     * Verified Claims can be requested on the level of individual Claims about the End-User by utilizing the claims parameter as defined in Section 5.5. of the OpenID Connect specification [OpenID](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#ClaimsParameter)
