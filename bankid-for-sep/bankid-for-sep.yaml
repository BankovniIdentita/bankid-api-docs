      description: |
        This GET endpoint is a starting point for OAuth2 and OpenID Connect authorization flows.Code grant and implicit grant is supported by Authorization. Is strictly recommended to 
        use `Authorization Code` flow [RFC6749 - The OAuth 2.0 Authorization Framework - Authorization Code](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-1.3.1).
        For `single-page-application` or `browser-based` apps is recommended to use `Authorization Code` flow with [PKCE - RFC7636](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7636)

        This request authenticates the user and returns tokens to the client application as a part of the callback response.

        **Technical scopes** (used in the `scope` query parameter):
        - openid (always required scope)  
        - offline_access (the scope must be specified if a refresh_token release is required)

        The token endpoint is used by the client to obtain an access token by presenting its authorization grant or refresh token.


        The means through which the client obtains the location of the token endpoint are beyond the scope of this specification, but the location
        is typically provided in the service documentation. The endpoint URI **MUST NOT** include a fragment component.


        Since requests to the token endpoint result in the transmission of clear-text credentials (in the HTTP request and response), the
        authorization server **MUST** require the use of TLS when sending requests to the token endpoint.


        If the Client is a Confidential Client, then it **MUST** authenticate to the token endpoint using the authentication method registered for its client_id,
        as described in Section 9 of [OpenID.Core](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#ClientAuthentication). 


        Parameters sent without a value **MUST** be treated as if they were omitted from the request. The authorization server MUST ignore
        unrecognized request parameters. Request and response parameters **MUST NOT** be included more than once.

      summary: Create a request object required for sign flow
      description: >
        Provides resource for SePs for initiation of authorization flow according OpenID Connect API
        Currently only document sign and Payment initiation is allowed. Further objects that could be subject to authorization will be allowed.
        Returns object identifier and url on which authorization is started. In case of document signature upload URL for document is returned.

        **Things to watch out for:**

          - ```structured_scope``` MUST contain either ```documentObject```, ```documentObjects``` or ```signObject```
          - ```documentObjects``` MUST contain at least one document, defined ```priority``` and 
           ```signObject``` MUST contain at least one field array element
          - elements outside the ```structured_scope``` (```response_type```, ```scope```, ```client_id```, …) contain common values as in the 
            authentication flow. The values must correspond to the configuration of the application in the development portal.
          - the ```document_id``` element can be any string, doesn't have to match the ```documentId``` value from the metadata of the PDF document
          - the ```document_hash``` element contains a bytearray hash of the content of the PDF document. The hash algorithm used 
            MUST be specified in the element ```hash_alg``` (Bank iD recommends using the SHA512 algorithm, see JSON example).
          - the ```document_uri``` could be any uri. **Even though it is mandatory, it's not beind validated!**
          - fields in the ```signObject``` element MUST have a defined ```priority``` that is unique as a number.
          - If ```sign_area``` and ```sign_field``` are not present, signature will be non-visual. 
          - If both ```sign_area``` and ```sign_field``` are in request, ```sign_field``` will have priority for visual signature and ```sign_area``` will be ignored.

          **Request payload of /ros endpoint is required in JWE format!** 

          Thus, the JSON payload request is first signed with the sig 
          key of the application in the form of JWS and then encrypted with ```enc``` Bank iD key (from JWKs issued on the Bank iD environment).

          You can find the correct URL of Bank iD JWKs keys for the given environment (Sandbox or Production) in the developer portal at
          setting up your application on the credentials tab after "unpacking" the OIDC Discovery area.

            not fulfill other conditions for processing the request. The error code will 
            typically be login_required, interaction_required, or another code defined in 
            Section 3.1.2.6. This can be used as a method to check for existing authentication 
            and/or consent.

        * login - The Authorization Server SHOULD prompt the End-User for reauthentication. 
            If it cannot reauthenticate the End-User, it MUST return an error, typically login_required.

        * consent - The Authorization Server SHOULD prompt the End-User for consent before 
            returning information to the Client. If it cannot obtain consent, it MUST return 
            an error, typically consent_required.

        The prompt parameter can be used by the Client to make sure that the End-User is still 
        present for the current session or to bring attention to the request. If this parameter 
        contains none with any other value, an error is returned.

            String value used to associate a Client session with an ID Token, and to mitigate replay attacks. The value is passed through unmodified from the Authentication 
            Request to the ID Token. If present in the ID Token, Clients MUST verify that the nonce Claim Value is equal to the value of the nonce parameter sent in the Authentication Request. 
            If present in the Authentication Request, Authorization Servers MUST include a nonce Claim in the ID Token with the Claim Value being the nonce value sent in the Authentication Request. 
            Authorization Servers SHOULD perform no other processing on nonce values used. The nonce value is a case sensitive string.

            Authentication Context Class Reference. String specifying an Authentication Context Class Reference value that identifies the Authentication Context Class that the authentication

            cookie, for instance, is one example where the use of "level 0" is appropriate. Authentications with level 0 SHOULD NOT be used to authorize access to any resource of any monetary value. 
            (This corresponds to the OpenID 2.0 PAPE [OpenID.PAPE] nist_auth_level 0.) An absolute URI or an RFC 6711 [RFC6711] registered name SHOULD be used as the acr value; registered names

            Authentication Methods References. JSON array of strings that are identifiers for authentication methods used in the authentication. For instance, values might indicate that both password and 
            OTP authentication methods were used. The definition of particular values to be used in the amr Claim is beyond the scope of this specification. Parties using this claim will need to agree 
            upon the meanings of the values used, which may be context-specific. The amr value is an array of case sensitive strings.
            The following is a list of Authentication Method Reference values defined by this specification:

            * face -
                Biometric authentication [RFC4949] using facial recognition

            * fpt -
                Biometric authentication [RFC4949] using a fingerprint

            * geo -
                Use of geolocation information for authentication, such as that provided by [W3C.REC-geolocation-API-20161108]

            * hwk -
                Proof-of-possession (PoP) of a hardware-secured key. See Appendix C of [RFC4211] for a discussion on PoP.

            * iris -
                Biometric authentication [RFC4949] using an iris scan

            * kba -
                Knowledge-based authentication [NIST.800-63-2] [ISO29115]

            * mca -
                Multiple-channel authentication [MCA].  The authentication involves communication over more than one distinct communication
                channel.  For instance, a multiple-channel authentication might involve both entering information into a workstation's browser and
                providing information on a telephone call to a pre-registered number.

            * mfa -
                Multiple-factor authentication [NIST.800-63-2]  [ISO29115].  When this is present, specific authentication methods used may also be
                included.

            * otp -
                One-time password [RFC4949].  One-time password specifications that this authentication method applies to include [RFC4226] and [RFC6238].

            * pin -
                Personal Identification Number (PIN) [RFC4949] or pattern (not restricted to containing only numbers) that a user enters to
                unlock a key on the device.  This mechanism should have a way to deter an attacker from obtaining the PIN by trying repeated guesses.

            * pwd -
                Password-based authentication [RFC4949]

            * rba -
                Risk-based authentication [JECM]

            * retina -
                Biometric authentication [RFC4949] using a retina scan

            * sc -
                Smart card [RFC4949]

            * sms -
                Confirmation using SMS [SMS] text message to the user at a registered number

            * swk -
                Proof-of-possession (PoP) of a software-secured key.  See Appendix C of [RFC4211] for a discussion on PoP.

            * tel -
                Confirmation by telephone call to the user at a registered number. This authentication technique is sometimes also referred to as
                "call back" [RFC4949].

            * user -
                User presence test.  Evidence that the End-User is present and interacting with the device.  This is sometimes also referred to
                as "test of user presence" [W3C.WD-webauthn-20170216].

            * vbm -
                Biometric authentication [RFC4949] using a voiceprint

            * wia -
                Windows integrated authentication [MSDN]

        jti:
          type: string
          description: >-
            The `jti` (JWT ID) claim provides a unique identifier for the JWT. The identifier value MUST be assigned in a manner that ensures that
            there is a negligible probability that the same value will be accidentally assigned to a different data object; if the application
            uses multiple issuers, collisions MUST be prevented among values produced by different issuers as well.  The `jti` claim can be used
            to prevent the JWT from being replayed.  The `jti` value is a case-sensitive string.

            The "key_ops" (key operations) parameter identifies the operation(s) for which the key is intended to be used.  The "key_ops" parameter is
            intended for use cases in which public, private, or symmetric keys may be present.


            Its value is an array of key operation values.  Values defined by  this specification are:
            * "sign" (compute digital signature or MAC)
            * "verify" (verify digital signature or MAC)
            * "encrypt" (encrypt content)
            * "decrypt" (decrypt content and validate decryption, if applicable)
            * "wrapKey" (encrypt key)
            * "unwrapKey" (decrypt key and validate decryption, if applicable)
            * "deriveKey" (derive key)
            * "deriveBits" (derive bits not to be used as a key)

            (Note that the "key_ops" values intentionally match the "KeyUsage" values defined in the Web Cryptography API
            [W3C.CR-WebCryptoAPI-20141211] specification.)


            Other values MAY be used.  The key operation values are case-sensitive strings.  Duplicate key operation values MUST NOT be
            present in the array.  Use of the "key_ops" member is OPTIONAL, unless the application requires its presence.


            Multiple unrelated key operations SHOULD NOT be specified for a key  because of the potential vulnerabilities associated with using the
            same key with multiple algorithms.  Thus, the combinations "sign" with "verify", "encrypt" with "decrypt", and "wrapKey" with
            "unwrapKey" are permitted, but other combinations SHOULD NOT be used.


            Additional "key_ops" (key operations) values can be registered in the IANA "JSON Web Key Operations" registry established by Section 8.3.
            The same considerations about registering extension values apply to the "key_ops" member as do for the "use" member.


            The "use" and "key_ops" JWK members SHOULD NOT be used together; however, if both are used, the information they convey MUST be
            consistent.  Applications should specify which of these members they use, if either is to be used by the application.

            The "use" (public key use) parameter identifies the intended use of the public key.  The "use" parameter is employed to indicate whether
            a public key is used for encrypting data or verifying the signature on data.


            Values defined by this specification are:
            *  "sig" (signature)
            *  "enc" (encryption)

            Other values MAY be used.  The "use" value is a case-sensitive string.  Use of the "use" member is OPTIONAL, unless the application
            requires its presence.

            When a key is used to wrap another key and a public key use designation for the first key is desired, the "enc" (encryption) key
            use value is used, since key wrapping is a kind of encryption.  The "enc" value is also to be used for public keys used for key agreement

            A list of defined "kty" values can be found in the IANA "JSON Web Key Types" registry established by [JWA]; the initial contents of this
            registry are the values defined in Section 6.1 of [JWA].


            The key type definitions include specification of the members to be used for those key types.  Members used with specific "kty" values

              * none - The Authorization Server MUST NOT display any authentication or consent user 
                  interface pages. An error is returned if an End-User is not already authenticated 
                  or the Client does not have pre-configured consent for the requested Claims or does 
                  not fulfill other conditions for processing the request. The error code will 
                  typically be login_required, interaction_required, or another code defined in 
                  Section 3.1.2.6. This can be used as a method to check for existing authentication 
                  and/or consent.

              * login - The Authorization Server SHOULD prompt the End-User for reauthentication. 
                  If it cannot reauthenticate the End-User, it MUST return an error, typically login_required.

              * consent - The Authorization Server SHOULD prompt the End-User for consent before 
                  returning information to the Client. If it cannot obtain consent, it MUST return 
                  an error, typically consent_required.

              The prompt parameter can be used by the Client to make sure that the End-User is still 
              present for the current session or to bring attention to the request. If this parameter 
              contains none with any other value, an error is returned.

          - **invalid_client** -
                Client authentication failed (e.g., unknown client, no client authentication included, or unsupported authentication method).  The authorization server MAY
                return an HTTP 401 (Unauthorized) status code to indicate which HTTP authentication schemes are supported.  If the client attempted to authenticate via the "Authorization"
                request header field, the authorization server MUST respond with an HTTP 401 (Unauthorized) status code and include the "WWW-Authenticate" response header field
                matching the authentication scheme used by the client.

          - **invalid_grant** -
                The provided authorization grant (e.g., authorization code, resource owner credentials) or refresh token is invalid, expired, revoked, does not match the redirection
                URI used in the authorization request, or was issued to another client.

                Proof-of-possession (PoP) of a software-secured key.  See Appendix C of [RFC4211] for a discussion on PoP.

            * tel -
                Confirmation by telephone call to the user at a registered number. This authentication technique is sometimes also referred to as "call back" [RFC4949].

            * user -
                User presence test.  Evidence that the End-User is present and interacting with the device.  This is sometimes also referred to as "test of user presence" [W3C.WD-webauthn-20170216].
